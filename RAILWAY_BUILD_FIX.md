# 🚂 Railway Build Failure - Complete Fix Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue: Build Failed After Git Push

This guide will help you fix the Railway build failure step by step.

## 🔧 Step 1: Fix Local Environment First

### 1.1 Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
source env/Scripts/activate
```

### 1.2 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements_railway.txt
```

### 1.3 Test Locally

```bash
python manage.py check --deploy
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

## 🔧 Step 2: Fix Railway Configuration

### 2.1 Check Railway Dashboard

1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. **Delete ALL existing environment variables**
5. Add these variables **one by one**:

```
Key: DEBUG
Value: False
```

```
Key: SECRET_KEY
Value: [generate using the script below]
```

```
Key: ALLOWED_HOSTS
Value: your-app-name.railway.app
```

### 2.2 Generate New SECRET_KEY

```bash
python generate_secret.py
```

## 🔧 Step 3: Update Git Repository

### 3.1 Commit All Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway build configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 3.2 Force Railway to Redeploy

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "Deploy" button
3. Monitor the build logs

## 🔧 Step 4: Check Build Logs

### 4.1 Common Build Errors & Solutions

**Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'whitenoise'"**

- ✅ Fixed: Using `requirements_railway.txt` with whitenoise==6.9.0

**Error: "invalid key-value pair"**

- ✅ Fixed: Add environment variables manually, one by one

**Error: "Build timeout"**

- ✅ Fixed: Simplified requirements file

**Error: "Database connection failed"**

- Add PostgreSQL plugin in Railway dashboard

## 🔧 Step 5: Alternative Deployment Method

If Railway continues to fail, try this alternative approach:

### 5.1 Use Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and link project
railway login
railway link

# Set variables via CLI
railway variables set DEBUG=False
railway variables set SECRET_KEY=your-generated-key
railway variables set ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app-name.railway.app

# Deploy
railway up
```

### 5.2 Manual Deployment Commands

```bash
# Test build locally
pip install -r requirements_railway.txt
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py check --deploy

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Railway build fix"
git push origin main
```

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Railway Logs

- Go to Railway dashboard
- Click on your project
- Go to "Deployments" tab
- Click on latest deployment
- Check "Build Logs" and "Deploy Logs"

### 2. Test Locally with Production Settings

```bash
export DEBUG=False
export SECRET_KEY=test-key
export ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost
python manage.py check --deploy
```

### 3. Verify Files Are Correct

Ensure these files exist and are correct:

- ✅ `railway.json`
- ✅ `requirements_railway.txt`
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml`
- ✅ `Procfile`
- ✅ `runtime.txt`

## 🎯 Quick Fix Commands

If you need to reset everything:

```bash
# 1. Activate environment
source env/Scripts/activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_railway.txt

# 3. Test locally
python manage.py check --deploy

# 4. Generate new secret key
python generate_secret.py

# 5. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Railway build fix"
git push origin main
```

## 📞 If Build Still Fails

### 1. Check Railway Status

- Visit [Railway Status](https://status.railway.app)
- Check if Railway is experiencing issues

### 2. Try Different Approach

- Delete and recreate the Railway project
- Use Railway CLI instead of dashboard
- Try deploying to a different branch

### 3. Contact Support

- Railway Discord: https://discord.gg/railway
- Railway Documentation: https://docs.railway.app
